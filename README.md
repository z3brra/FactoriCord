# ðŸ§© FactoriCord

**FactoriCord** is a lightweight, fully autonomous bridge between **Factorio** and **Discord**.
It logs in-game activity : 
- joins
- leaves
- deaths
- sessions
- tchat brige coming soon
- More in the future updates

and syncs it to your Discord server or external tools through a **decentralized API**.

**no setup, no maintenance, no coding required.**

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Tracks player joins, leaves, and deaths automatically
- Logs all events in structured JSON files
- Works out of the box : no commands or manual setup
- Designed for integration with Discord bots and dashboards
- Built for **Factorio 2.0**

FactoriCord runs **silently and autonomously** in the background.

Once installed, it handles everything, collecting and formatting your server data in discord embeds without needing user interaction.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy
FactoriCord is part of a **decentralized ecosystem**:  
- The **Factorio mod** collects and structures the data  
- The **Discord bot** processes and displays it in real time  
- The **API** connects them seamlessly.

You donâ€™t need to configure anything, the system works and is installed semi automatically and keeps your logs up to date.
