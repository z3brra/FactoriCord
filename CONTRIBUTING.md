# Contributing

Contributions aren't open at the moment.
Due to my studies, I currently do not have the time to follow and check contributions.

## Open source - roadmap

The project aims to become **entirely open source**.

Currently :
- The **FactoriCord** is available in **readable source code**.

In a second phase (planned for **this summer, around June / July**), the following components will also be published as open source, accompanied by a comprehensive contributiuon guide :

- **API Client** : Python
- **Central API** : PHP (Symfony)
- **Discord bot** : Python (discord.py)

Once this phase is launched, contributions will be officially open and supervised.
